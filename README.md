Fell in love in programming when I first crosspath with it back in polytechnic during the 90s. Had fair amount of chances to nurture it, during Uni and some projects in the military. Now that I retired after serving for more than two decades, so here I come...

**Changes that I observed**

Well ... 
1. Programming or coding - Nobody called it coding back then, or at least not where I am from LOL. 
2. Good program is called "strong algorithm" then.
3. Scripts are owned - You can even sell it and definitely there isn't GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or ...
4. Learning has becomes a breeze - besides the above, there are YouTube and more! You even need to pay to get a IDE! 
5. Colourful IDE - Simply love this. It was all plaintext mono-colour. Missing a bracket, GBY!  
6. Syntax - Learned python on my own and I simply wonder why do we still need to end with a ";" these days?!?

Learning never stops :runner:!
